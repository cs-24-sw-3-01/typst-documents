= Introduction
The project is accomplished in collaboration with KMD, a company located in Aalborg. They develop IT solutions aimed at meeting the changing digital needs of modern societies. 

The process of finding a collaborative company was to search through the company guidebook “Peiling”, which was delivered by attending a student job fair. After finding a few interesting companies, emails were sent to arrange a meeting. During the first meeting with KMD, they showed significant interest in the collaboration and were willing to provide as many resources as possible, such as finding employees for interviews and providing access to a hosting server. Their high level of interest gave motivation and a desire to collaborate with them. 

The purpose of this project is to develop a functional application that focuses on user experience and solves the client’s needs. The requirement for this system would be a holiday planner to track non-working days for the company’s employees. KMD already has a holiday planner, but since it’s an old version, they wish to renew this system.
